<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./screenShot.png)
I built this project to practice TDD. I chose this challenge because it is short and simple and let me focus more on testing.

The project is a simple image uploader where you can drop or select an image from your system to save it to the server.

<!-- The project will be deployed on Heroku so if you test it the images that you upload are not going to persist. When the Heroku dynos shut down the images will be lost from the server disk. -->
